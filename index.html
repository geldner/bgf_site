                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>The Barbara Geldner Project is currently an unincorporated volunteer organization. We intend to incorporate as a 501(c)(3) once we have identified suitable and willing board members and demonstrated financial liability. Once incorporated, the foundation will subsidize its primary activities (<a href="mission.html">described here</a>) with relevant fee-for-service research activities including scientific advisory, methodological review and quality-control, and R&D contracting services. We will also seek grant funding and charitable donations as applicable. 
                    While near-term operations will resemble those of a not-for-profit consultancy, we aspire to function as a research foundation, working to overcome mismatched incentive stuctures and facilitate innovative and impactful work to sustainably advance the state of practice across our active application domains.</p>
